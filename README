Drupal module adding a field formatter for text fields. The field will link to another node if a selected field of the second node shares an identical value with the formatted field.

Example:

Formatted field: field_employee_companyname
Option field: field_company_name

If the two fields are identical, the first field will link to the Company node. Otherwise there are no changes.
